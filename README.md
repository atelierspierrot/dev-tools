Dev Tools

This package is a set of shell scripts to help managing a package life-cycle, such as cleaning
up some un-wanted files to prepare a deployment, actually deploy the package loading some
environment specific files and helping create some GIT version TAGs.

## Usage

    sh ./deploy.sh

For available actions, run:

    sh ./deploy.sh -z

To run an action, run:

    sh ./deploy.sh [options]Â action_name
